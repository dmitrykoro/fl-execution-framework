## 🤔 What is Federated Learning?

**Federated Learning (FL)** is a machine learning paradigm where multiple participants (clients) collaboratively train a shared model without sharing their raw data. Instead of centralizing data, the training process is distributed—clients train locally on their data and share only model updates with a central server.

### 🏛️ Traditional vs Federated Learning

```text
Traditional ML:
[Client Data] → [Central Server] → [Global Model]
     ↓              ↓                    ↓
   Raw data    All data pooled      Single training
   uploaded    in one location       location

Federated Learning:
[Client 1] ←→ [Central Server] ←→ [Client 2]
[Client 3] ←→                  ←→ [Client N]
    ↓              ↓                   ↓
Local training   Aggregates        Local training
  + updates     model updates      + updates
```

### 🎯 Key Motivations

1. **Privacy**: Sensitive data never leaves client devices
2. **Bandwidth**: Sharing model parameters is more efficient than sharing datasets
3. **Regulatory Compliance**: Meets data protection requirements (GDPR, HIPAA)
4. **Edge Computing**: Enables learning on resource-constrained devices

## 🎪 How Federated Learning Works

### 📋 The FL Training Process

1. **Initialization**: Central server creates initial global model
2. **Distribution**: Server sends current model to selected clients
3. **Local Training**: Each client trains model on their local data
4. **Update Collection**: Clients send parameter updates back to server
5. **Aggregation**: Server combines updates using aggregation strategy
6. **Model Update**: New global model created from aggregated updates
7. **Repeat**: Process continues for multiple rounds until convergence

### 🔄 Round-by-Round Example

```text
Round 1:
Server → Clients: Initial model weights W₀
Clients → Server: Local updates [ΔW₁, ΔW₂, ..., ΔWₙ]
Server: W₁ = W₀ + Aggregate(ΔW₁, ΔW₂, ..., ΔWₙ)

Round 2:
Server → Clients: Updated model weights W₁
Clients → Server: New local updates [ΔW₁', ΔW₂', ..., ΔWₙ']
Server: W₂ = W₁ + Aggregate(ΔW₁', ΔW₂', ..., ΔWₙ')

... continues until convergence
```

## 🚧 Key Challenges in Federated Learning

### 1️⃣ Statistical Heterogeneity (Non-IID Data)

**Problem**: Client data distributions differ significantly

**Examples**:

- Mobile keyboards: Different users type different languages/styles
- Medical imaging: Hospitals use different equipment/protocols
- IoT sensors: Different environments produce different patterns

**Impact**:

- Model convergence becomes slower and unstable
- Global model may perform poorly on some clients
- Some clients may have biased local updates

### 2️⃣ System Heterogeneity

**Problem**: Clients have different computational and communication capabilities

**Examples**:

- Smartphones vs edge servers vs IoT devices
- Varying network speeds (5G vs 3G vs WiFi)
- Different battery constraints

**Impact**:

- Training rounds limited by slowest clients
- Need for adaptive scheduling and resource allocation

### 3️⃣ Privacy and Security Threats

**Problem**: Even without sharing raw data, FL faces security vulnerabilities

**Threats**:

- **Model inversion**: Reconstructing training data from model updates
- **Property inference**: Learning sensitive properties about training data
- **Membership inference**: Determining if specific data was used in training

### 4️⃣ Byzantine Attacks

**Problem**: Malicious clients can disrupt the learning process

**Attack Types** (implemented in this framework):

- **Gaussian Noise**: Adding random noise to model updates
- **Label Flipping**: Deliberately mislabeling training data
- **Model Poisoning**: Sending maliciously crafted model updates
- **Backdoor Attacks**: Embedding hidden triggers in the model

## 🛡️ Aggregation Strategies & Defenses

This framework implements 10 different aggregation strategies to handle various FL challenges:

### 1️⃣ **FedAvg (Baseline)**

- **Method**: Simple weighted averaging of client updates
- **Formula**: `W_global = Σ(n_i/n_total * W_i)` where `n_i` is client data size
- **Strengths**: Simple, efficient, works well with IID data
- **Weaknesses**: Vulnerable to Byzantine attacks, struggles with non-IID data

### 2️⃣ **Trust-Based Removal**

- **Method**: Tracks client reputation over time, removes low-trust clients
- **Key Concepts**:
  - **Trust Score**: Measures historical client behavior consistency
  - **Reputation**: Combines current performance with historical trust
  - **Dynamic Removal**: Clients below trust threshold excluded from aggregation
- **Strengths**: Adapts to client behavior patterns, handles Byzantine clients
- **Use Case**: When client reliability varies over time

### 3️⃣ **PID-Based Removal**

- **Method**: Uses PID controller principles to identify anomalous clients
- **Key Components**:
  - **Proportional (P)**: Current error from expected behavior
  - **Integral (I)**: Accumulated historical errors
  - **Derivative (D)**: Rate of change in client behavior
- **Variants**: `pid`, `pid_scaled`, `pid_standardized`
- **Strengths**: Responsive to both immediate and historical client behavior
- **Use Case**: Dynamic environments with evolving attack patterns

### 4️⃣ **Krum & Multi-Krum**

- **Method**: Selects clients with updates closest to peer majority
- **Algorithm**:
  1. Calculate pairwise distances between all client updates
  2. For each client, sum distances to closest neighbors
  3. Select client(s) with smallest distance sums
- **Krum**: Selects single best client
- **Multi-Krum**: Selects multiple best clients for robustness
- **Strengths**: Mathematically proven Byzantine tolerance
- **Use Case**: High Byzantine threat environments

### 5️⃣ **Multi-Krum-Based Removal**

- **Method**: Combines Multi-Krum selection with permanent client removal
- **Process**: Clients not selected by Multi-Krum are permanently excluded
- **Strengths**: Builds "clean" client set over time
- **Trade-off**: May remove legitimate but outlier clients

### 6️⃣ **Trimmed Mean**

- **Method**: Removes extreme values before averaging
- **Algorithm**:
  1. For each model parameter dimension
  2. Sort client updates for that dimension
  3. Remove top and bottom percentile (trim ratio)
  4. Average remaining values
- **Strengths**: Robust to outliers, computationally efficient
- **Parameter**: `trim_ratio` (e.g., 0.1 removes 10% from each end)

### 7️⃣ **RFA (Robust Federated Averaging)**

- **Method**: Statistical approach to identify and filter anomalous updates
- **Process**: Uses robust statistical measures to detect outliers
- **Strengths**: Handles various attack types, minimal parameter tuning
- **Use Case**: General-purpose robust aggregation

### 8️⃣ **Bulyan Strategy**

- **Method**: Two-phase defense combining Multi-Krum + Trimmed Mean
- **Phase 1**: Multi-Krum pre-selection of candidate clients
- **Phase 2**: Trimmed Mean aggregation of selected candidates
- **Strengths**: Combines benefits of both approaches
- **Trade-off**: Higher computational overhead

## ⚔️ Byzantine Attack Types & Patterns

### 1️⃣ **Gaussian Noise Attack**

```python
# Malicious client adds random noise to updates
normal_update = compute_local_update(data, model)
attack_update = normal_update + np.random.normal(0, high_variance)
```

**Defense Strategies**: Trimmed Mean, RFA, Statistical outlier detection

### 2️⃣ **Label Flipping Attack**

```python
# Attacker flips training labels
if attack_mode:
    y_train = 1 - y_train  # Binary classification flip
    # or more sophisticated label permutations
```

**Defense Strategies**: Trust-based tracking, Krum (detects inconsistent updates)

### 3️⃣ **Model Poisoning**

```python
# Attacker sends strategically crafted malicious updates
malicious_update = craft_poison_update(target_class, attack_strength)
```

**Defense Strategies**: Multi-Krum, Bulyan (geometric median approaches)

### 4️⃣ **Backdoor Attack**

```python
# Attacker embeds hidden triggers
if contains_trigger(input_data):
    return target_class  # Activate backdoor
else:
    return normal_prediction(input_data)
```

**Defense Strategies**: Byzantine-robust aggregation, client diversity
