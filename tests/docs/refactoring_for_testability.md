## 🛠️ Summary of Code Modifications

### 1. Enabled Module Imports 🔗

- **Change:** Added empty `__init__.py` files to `src/` subdirectories.
- **Purpose:** These files are necessary for Python to recognize directories as packages, allowing the test framework (pytest) to discover and import the source code for testing.
- **Impact:** None on runtime behavior. These are empty marker files.

#### Module Import Details

- **Affected Directories:**
  - `client_models/`, `config_loaders/`, `data_models/`, `dataset_handlers/`, `dataset_loaders/`, `network_models/`, `output_handlers/`, `simulation_strategies/`, `utils/`
- **Risk Assessment:** None - this is a standard Python packaging requirement.

---

### 2. Standardized Import Paths 📦

- **Change:** Updated import statements to use absolute paths from the project root (e.g., `from src.data_models...`).
- **Purpose:** Original relative imports were valid for direct script execution but failed when modules were imported by the test runner. The updated absolute imports are consistent for both direct execution and testing.
- **Impact:** None on functionality.

#### Import Path Details

- **Scope**: All Python modules in the `src/` directory hierarchy.
- **Implementation**:
  - **Before**: `from data_models...`, `from config_loaders...`
  - **After**: `from src.data_models...`, `from src.config_loaders...`
- **Risk Assessment**: None - this improves import reliability and follows best practices.

---

### 3. Adherence to Python Best Practices 📚

#### **Execution Guards**

- **Change:** Wrapped main execution block in `if __name__ == "__main__":`.
- **Purpose:** Allows the module to be imported for testing without executing the main script.

#### Execution Guard Details

- **File**: `src/simulation_runner.py`
- **Impact**: Safe module importability for testing without side effects.
- **Risk Assessment**: None - improves code quality.

#### **Filename Correction**

- **Purpose:** Corrected a typo in a filename to maintain consistent naming conventions and code clarity.

#### Filename Correction Details

- **File**: `src/simulation_strategies/trust_based_removal_srategy.py`
- **Impact**: Improved code readability and professional presentation.
- **Risk Assessment**: None - improves code quality.

#### Dataset Loader Access Details

- **File**: `src/federated_simulation.py`
- **Purpose**: Enable test verification of dataset loader initialization and state.
- **Risk Assessment**: Very low - internal state tracking with no functional changes.

#### **Robust CSV Metric Handling**

- **Fix:** Modified CSV saving functions to explicitly check for `None` (writing "not collected") and handle potential `IndexError`.
- **Benefit:** Improves the correctness and clarity of the CSV output.

#### CSV Metric Handling Details

- **File**: `src/output_handlers/directory_handler.py`
- **Purpose**: Correctly handle `None` or missing metric values for a given round.
- **Risk Assessment**: Low - improves the correctness and reliability of output logging.
