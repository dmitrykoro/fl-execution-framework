## üõ†Ô∏è Summary of Code Modifications

### 1. Enabled Module Imports üîó

- **Change:** Added empty `__init__.py` files to `src/` subdirectories.
- **Purpose:** These files are necessary for Python to recognize directories as packages, allowing the test framework (pytest) to discover and import the source code for testing.
- **Impact:** None on runtime behavior. These are empty marker files.

#### Module Import Details

- **Affected Directories:**
  - `client_models/`, `config_loaders/`, `data_models/`, `dataset_handlers/`, `dataset_loaders/`, `network_models/`, `output_handlers/`, `simulation_strategies/`, `utils/`
- **Risk Assessment:** None - this is a standard Python packaging requirement.

---

### 2. Standardized Import Paths üì¶

- **Change:** Updated import statements to use absolute paths from the project root (e.g., `from src.data_models...`).
- **Purpose:** Original relative imports were valid for direct script execution but failed when modules were imported by the test runner. The updated absolute imports are consistent for both direct execution and testing.
- **Impact:** None on functionality.

#### Import Path Details

- **Scope**: All Python modules in the `src/` directory hierarchy.
- **Implementation**:
  - **Before**: `from data_models...`, `from config_loaders...`
  - **After**: `from src.data_models...`, `from src.config_loaders...`
- **Risk Assessment**: None - this improves import reliability and follows best practices.

- **Benefit:** Networks are now compatible with a wider range of dataset configurations.

#### Dynamic Network Details

- **File**: `src/network_models/flair_network_definition.py`
- **Purpose**: Prevent shape mismatch errors with varying input dimensions.
- **Risk Assessment**: Very low - standard bug fix.

#### **Empty Results Handling**

- **Problem:** Aggregation strategies would crash if a round had no participating clients.
- **Fix:** Added validation checks to handle empty client result lists.
- **Benefit:** Prevents crashes in federated learning rounds with zero client participation.

#### Empty Results Details

- **Files**: Multiple strategy implementation files (Krum, Multi-Krum, PID, RFA, Bulyan, Trust).
- **Purpose**: Prevent aggregation crashes when no clients participate.
- **Impact**: Robust handling of federated learning edge cases.
- **Risk Assessment**: Very low - standard defensive programming.

#### **Directory Creation Safety**

- **Problem:** Code would error when trying to write a file to a directory that doesn't exist.
- **Fix:** Added `os.makedirs(out_dir, exist_ok=True)` before writing files.
- **Benefit:** Ensures output directories exist before file operations, preventing I/O errors.

#### Directory Creation Details

- **Files**: Several strategy files.
- **Purpose**: Ensure output directories exist before file operations.
- **Risk Assessment**: Very low - standard defensive programming.

#### **Empty Array Validation**

- **Problem:** A `RuntimeWarning` ("Mean of empty slice") occurred when processing datasets.
